# Hr-Data-Analytics-for-Green-Destination-Company

## Background Information
Green Destinations is a well known travel agency. The HR Director has recently noticed an
increase in employees leaving (attrition). She wanted to figure out any trends or patterns.
She has surveyed the staff of Green Destinations and provided me with the data.
She wanted to know what the attrition rate is (% of people who have left).
She also wanted to know if factors like age, years at the company and income play a part in
determining if people will leave or not.

In this project, I analyse and design an intuitive HR Analysis Dashboard unveiling insights based on attrition state of the company. The dashboard contains information such as Atrrtion Rate, Attrition by department, Attrition by Age among others. click the button below to check for details in this project.
