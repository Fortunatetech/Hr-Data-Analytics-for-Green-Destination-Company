# Green-Destination-Company
In this project, I analyse and design an intuitive HR Analysis Dashboard unveiling insights based on request of the HR. 
The dashboard contains information such as Atrrtion Rate, Employee Count by Age, Employee Count by Monthly Income among others. 

## Background Information
Green Destinations is a well known travel agency. The HR Director has recently noticed an
increase in employees leaving (attrition). She wanted to figure out any trends or patterns.
She has surveyed the staff of Green Destinations and provided me with the data.

## Tools Needed
Install Tableau Public on your system.

## Task 
She wanted to know what the attrition rate is (% of people who have left).
She also wanted to know if factors like age, years at the company and income play a part in
determining if people will leave or not.
